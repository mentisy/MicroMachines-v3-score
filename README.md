# MicroMachines v3 Scoresheet #
A small web application to keep tabs on scores on the multiplayer variant of the PlayStation One game called Micro Machines v3. As the game crashes quite often, the results are lost. This was built as we used a notepad to keep the scores, but the assigned score keeper sucked at math. 

### Used libraries ###
* Bootstrap 4
* jQuery 3.2.1
###### Mainly because I'm lazy. ######
